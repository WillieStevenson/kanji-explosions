Kanji Explosions


The animation script I made for the landing page of my site https://kanade.io

It's based off of TweenMax.js which is an extension of the TweenLite Engine.

The original idea is a fork of Allen Pope's explosion script found here: http://codepen.io/allanpope/pen/vOKVjq


Be careful when you run this script. It will eat your battery. Definitely do not run it on your mobile device.

One day, I will get around to fixing it.
